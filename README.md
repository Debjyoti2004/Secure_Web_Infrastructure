# Secure Web Infrastructure Project AWS Optimization for Scalable, Efficient, and Streamlined Access.

## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing AWS infrastructure to provide a secure, scalable, and efficient web environment. Key features include automated scaling, secure access, and streamlined software deployment. Below is an outline of the infrastructure components and configurations used.

## Features

- **Secure Website Access:** 
  - Configured GoDaddy DNS to direct traffic to an ACM-secured endpoint.
  - Implemented HTTPS load balancer with dedicated security protocols.

- **Automated Scaling:**
  - Automated scaling of Tomcat instances based on demand.
  - Managed instance security with segregated security groups.

- **Backend Services:**
  - Orchestrated MySQL, Memcache, and RabbitMQ services.
  - Utilized Amazon Route 53 Private DNS for internal DNS management.

- **Deployment:**
  - Used Amazon S3 for streamlined software deployment.

- **Documentation:**
  - Provided comprehensive setup documentation for an optimized, scalable AWS infrastructure.

## Architecture

1. **DNS Configuration:**
   - **Domain Provider:** GoDaddy
   - **DNS Setup:** Points to ACM-secured endpoint for HTTPS traffic.

2. **Load Balancing:**
   - **Type:** HTTPS Load Balancer
   - **Security:** Includes dedicated security protocols and encryption.

3. **Scaling and Security:**
   - **Tomcat Instances:** Automated scaling based on traffic demand.
   - **Security Groups:** Segregated for different components to ensure security.

4. **Backend Services:**
   - **MySQL:** Managed relational database service.
   - **Memcache:** In-memory caching for performance enhancement.
   - **RabbitMQ:** Message broker for inter-service communication.
   - **DNS:** Amazon Route 53 Private DNS for internal resolution.

5. **Deployment:**
   - **Tool:** Amazon S3
   - **Purpose:** Storage and retrieval of deployment artifacts.

## Setup Instructions

1. **DNS Configuration:**
   - Configure GoDaddy DNS to point to the ACM-secured endpoint.

2. **Load Balancer Setup:**
   - Set up an HTTPS Load Balancer with required security protocols.

3. **Tomcat Instances:**
   - Configure auto-scaling policies and security groups.

4. **Backend Services:**
   - Deploy MySQL, Memcache, and RabbitMQ.
   - Configure Amazon Route 53 Private DNS for internal services.

5. **Deployment Process:**
   - Upload deployment artifacts to Amazon S3.
   - Implement continuous integration and deployment processes.
